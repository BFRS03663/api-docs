# Shiprocket API — Overview, Authentication & Conventions

> Generated from the published Postman collection behind [https://apidocs.shiprocket.in/](https://apidocs.shiprocket.in/) (collection "Shiprocket API", published id `SzYW1zB2`, version tag `latest`). Only content present in that collection is reproduced here; where the source omits something, the omission is stated.

## About this reference

This file holds the general sections of the Shiprocket API documentation (getting started, usage guidelines, error codes, webhooks) and the Authentication endpoints. Endpoint reference for the other categories lives in the sibling files linked from `llms.txt`.

## Base URLs

Hosts that appear in request URLs across the collection:

- `https://apiv2.shiprocket.in` — used by 91 request(s)
- `https://serviceability.shiprocket.in` — used by 2 request(s)

Almost all endpoints are under the `/v1/external/` prefix. The source does not publish a separate sandbox or staging base URL.

Welcome to Shiprocket's API Documentation. We've designed this document to help developers and Shiprocket users fully understand and integrate our API for a seamless and easy deployment. These APIs enable you to utilize most of your Shiprocket account's panel features fully.

We've listed all the APIs, their required parameters, and their example requests and responses on the right for easy understanding. The easiest way to start using the Shiprocket APIs is by clicking the **Run in Postman** button above. The [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a free tool that helps developers run and debug API requests.

Our APIs are based around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) architecture and use the basic [HTTP](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_status_codes) request methods. Our APIs accept [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) - encoded body requests and return data in the same form.

Read through the following sections for the integration process.

## Getting Started

First, you need to register with ShipRocket and create an account. Click on this [link](https://app.shiprocket.in/register) to complete the sign-up process.

After the sign-up process is complete, follow the steps listed below to create an API user:

1. Log in to your Shiprocket account.
2. From the left-hand menu, go to:<br> **Settings → API → Add New API User**
3. Click on "Create API User."
4. In the pop-up form:<br> . Enter a **unique email address** (must be different from the one used for your main Shiprocket login).<br> . Under **Modules to Access**, select the relevant **API modules** you want your user to access.<br> . Under **Buyer's Details Access**, choose either "**Allowed**" or "**Not Allowed**" based on your requirement.
5. Click on "**Create User.**"
6. Copy your Admin API password or API key immediately, as we will not show it again for security reasons.

Once created, you can proceed to generate an auth token using the Authentication API for further integration.

## Document and API Usage Guidelines

- Our APIs use the basic HTTP request codes: *POST*, *GET*, *PATCH*, & *PUT*.
- You can select the required response and request code language by selecting it from the drop-down menu on the top.
- You can import and test all our full API collection in the Postman app by clicking on the **' Run in Postman'** button.
- **Note**: Any requests made using the valid API credentials will affect the real-time data in your Shiprocket account.
- Authorization: Bearer
- All the APIs are provided with their appropriate example requests and responses for successful and failed calls. The example definitions are:

    - **Successful Call**: The API call was correct.
    - **Invalid Data**: The data entered was incorrect.
    - **Missing Fields**: Some of the required fields are missing.
    - **Wrong Format**: There is a syntax error in the code.
- **Note**: The `order_id` defined by you at the time of order creation is your reference order id. The `order_id` returned in the API response is the *Shiprocket order id*. All our APIs will use this Shiprocket order id to access your created order unless stated otherwise.

## Errors and Response codes

While using Shiprocket's APIs, you may run into some standard response and error codes. The most common ones are listed along with their descriptions as follows:

| **RESPONSE CODE** | **DESCRIPTION** |
|---|---|
| `200` & `202` - **OK** & **Accepted** | Everything worked as expected, and you'll get a response. Some APIs may respond with an error message if data is invalid. |
| `400` - **Bad Request** | The request was invalid or cannot be otherwise served. |
| `401` - **Unauthorized** | There is some error during validation. You need to check your token or credentials. |
| `404` - **Not Found** | The URI requested is invalid or the resource requested does not exist. |
| `405` - **Method Not Allowed** | The API was accessed using the wrong method. Check your HTTP method. |
| `422` - **Unprocessable Entity** | It means the request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fulfilled. Try checking your code for errors. |
| `429` - **Too Many Requests** | You have exceeded the API call rate limit. |
| `500`, `502`, `503`, `504` - **Server Errors** | Some server error has occurred. Some APIs may show this due to syntax or parameter errors. Try contacting support if this persists. |

## Webhooks

You can set up a webhook with Shiprocket to get tracking updates. We will proactively notify your system whenever there is a new tracking event for an order.

**Setup**:

- Log in to your Shiprocket account
- Go to Settings > API > Webhooks
- Add the webhook URL
- Enable the toggle
- Add the security token (not mandatory)

When we get a new tracking event, a POST request is made to the callback URL you added to your Shiprocket account.

**Webhook Specifications:**

- Method: POST
- The `Content-Type` header should be set to `application/json`
- Please do not use keywords like shiprocket, kartrocket, sr, or kr in your webhook URL
- Security token should be an`x-api-key`
- The URL should be set to send only code 200 in response.

## Coverage notes

- Requests in source collection: 93 across 22 top-level folders. All are documented; 10 entries are exact duplicates of another entry and are cross-referenced instead of repeated: Hyperlocal / Orders / Get Specific Order Details; Hyperlocal / Orders / Export your orders; Hyperlocal / Tracking / Get Tracking through AWB; Hyperlocal / Tracking / Get Tracking Data for Multiple AWBS; Hyperlocal / Tracking / Get Tracking through Shipment ID; Hyperlocal / Tracking / Get Tracking Data through Order ID; Hyperlocal / Pickup Addresses / Get All Pickup Locations; International / Tracking / Get Tracking through AWB; International / Tracking / Get Tracking through Shipment ID; International / Tracking / Get Tracking Data through Order iD.
- Requests with no description in the source: Authentication API / Generate Token.
- Requests whose description is only the endpoint URL: Authentication API / Token Logout.
- Requests with no published example response: Authentication API / Generate Token; Authentication API / Token Logout; Couriers / Upload Blocked Pincodes; Return & Exchange Orders / Check Courier Serviceability; Return & Exchange Orders / Generate AWB for Return Shipment.
- Folders with no folder-level description: Return & Exchange Orders; Hyperlocal; Account; Listings.
- Request and response schemas are not published as formal schemas (no OpenAPI/JSON Schema exists for this API); the parameter tables and example payloads reproduced here are the only structure the source provides.
- Base64 file contents in the International KYC examples are truncated in this reference; a note marks each truncation.
- Some International example requests use URLs without the `/v1` segment (for example `https://apiv2.shiprocket.in/external/international/courier/assign/awb`) while the request template uses `/v1/external/international/...`. Both forms are reproduced as published; the source does not say which is canonical.
- The `Sense` and `Shiprocket MCP Server` sections of the source are descriptive only and publish no endpoints.
- No numeric rate limits, pagination defaults, or sandbox base URL are published in the source.

## Authentication API

The authentication token is an alphanumeric code, unique to your Shiprocket account, can be used from any system to validate your API calls to access Shiprocket's resources. Shiprocket API uses [JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/) tokens for validation.

Use this API to validate your API user and obtain the authentication token. Copy this token and use it further to validate your API calls. **The validity of this token is 10 days**.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret token in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

**Steps To Use Token:**

1. Copy the token received in response.
2. Include ***'Authorization: Bearer [yourtokenvalue]'*** in the appropriate field of your code.
3. That's all! In case of any error, try checking your parameters.

### Generate Token

`POST https://apiv2.shiprocket.in/v1/external/auth/login`

**Authentication:** None. This call issues the token; send the API user email and password in the body.

**Request headers**

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |

**Description:** not provided in the source collection for this request.

**Request body template** (as published; empty strings are placeholders to fill in)

```json
{
    "email": "",
    "password": ""
}
```

**Example responses:** none published in the source collection for this request.

### Token Logout

`POST https://apiv2.shiprocket.in/v1/external/auth/logout`

**Authentication:** Bearer token in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header (collection-wide guideline; token comes from Generate Token). The request template lists the header explicitly with value `Bearer xxx`.

**Request headers**

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `Authorization` | `Bearer xxx` |

**Description**

[https://apiv2.shiprocket.in/v1/external/auth/logout](https://apiv2.shiprocket.in/v1/external/auth/logout)

**Example responses:** none published in the source collection for this request.
